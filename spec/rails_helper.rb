# Integration spec helper. Boots the spec/dummy/ Rails app and provides
# Rack::Test for request dispatch. Unit specs continue to use spec_helper.rb
# (no Rails boot).

# Load stdlib Logger BEFORE any Rails/ActiveSupport require. ActiveSupport
# 5.2/6.0/6.1 references `Logger::Severity` inside
# `lib/active_support/logger_thread_safe_level.rb` without first requiring
# "logger", which works on Ruby 2.x (Logger was autoloaded more eagerly)
# but raises `NameError: uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger`
# on Ruby 3.x. Rails 7.0+ fixed this at the AS level; older Rails combined
# with Ruby 3.x needs this workaround. The matrix cells affected are
# Ruby 3.0-3.3 × Rails 5.2/6.0/6.1 in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

# .rspec has `--require spec_helper`, so spec_helper is auto-loaded before
# rails_helper. spec_helper calls `require "sql_genius"` when Rails is not
# yet defined, so lib/sql_genius.rb skips `require "sql_genius/engine"`
# (which is guarded by `if defined?(Rails)`). By the time the dummy app boots
# and application.rb calls `require "sql_genius"`, the gem is already loaded
# and the require is a no-op — Engine is never defined.
#
# Fix: require Rails and the engine explicitly before booting the dummy app.

# Stub ActiveRecord::Base before the dummy app boots, because Rails will
# try to reference it if any railtie reaches for it. We don't load the
# ActiveRecord railtie in the dummy app, so AR::Base is only referenced
# at test time through SqlGenius's own code.
